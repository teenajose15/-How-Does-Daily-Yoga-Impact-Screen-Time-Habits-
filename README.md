# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Impact of Daily Yoga on Screen Time Habits

## Project Overview

This project explores the relationship between daily yoga practice and screen time habits. Through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), we aim to understand how engaging in yoga can influence screen time behavior, especially in different categories like social networking, productivity, and health & fitness.

The dataset includes daily information on screen time habits, categorized by usage type, as well as whether yoga was practiced on each day. This analysis provides insights into how yoga might impact screen time and whether regular yoga practice can reduce overall screen time, especially in specific usage categories.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains the following columns:

- **Date**: The specific date of the entry.
- **Week Day**: The day of the week (e.g., Monday, Tuesday, etc.).
- **Screen Time Categories**:
  - **Social Networking**: Time spent on social media.
  - **Reading and Reference**: Time spent on reading or referencing materials.
  - **Other**: Time spent on other activities.
  - **Productivity**: Time spent on work or productive tasks.
  - **Health and Fitness**: Time spent on health-related activities, including yoga.
- **Yoga**: Indicates whether yoga was practiced on that day (Yes/No).

The goal of this analysis is to find patterns in the data, test hypotheses, and determine if yoga has a noticeable effect on screen time habits over time.

## Objectives

- **Hypothesis Testing**: Formulate and test hypotheses such as "Daily yoga practice reduces screen time" or "Yoga influences screen time across different categories."
- **Data Grouping**: Group data by weeks or months to observe long-term trends and changes in screen time.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize and analyze the data using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
- **Insights**: Extract actionable insights regarding screen time behaviors, the impact of yoga, and possible correlations with external factors like sleep hygiene or mealtime screen restrictions.

## Tools & Libraries

This project uses the following tools and libraries:

- **Python**
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **Seaborn**: For advanced data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For conducting analysis and visualization interactively.
